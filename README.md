# Social-media-Data-Analytics

This project is a review on the paper entitled as "Social media data analytics to improve supply chain management in food industries"
# Let's discuss a general question first.
Imagine you have created a diary milk chocolate product  and 1000 chocolates already sold. Now you want to know what's the feedback of the diary milk?

So here you will ask to the customers about the product taste, color, packaging and the cost satisfaction with respect to quality. But asking 1000 people and collecting the information is so time consuming. So other method can be a social media where generally people share their opinion ex Twitter. This is the reason behind choosing Twitter for further analysis.

Now coming to the paper the issue is similar to the above example. 

I found this paper really relevant as the authors spoke about Sentiment analysis, hierarchical clustering, bootstrap resampling, big-data analytics in Food industries.

This paper proposes a big-data analytics-based approach that considers social media (Twitter) data for the identification of supply chain management issues in food industries. In particular, the proposed approach includes text analysis using a support vector machine (SVM) and hierarchical clustering with multiscale bootstrap resampling. The result of this approach included a cluster of words which could inform supply-chain (SC) decision makers about customer feedback and issues in the flow/quality of food products. A case study in the beef supply chain was analysed using the proposed approach, where three weeks of data from Twitter were used.
